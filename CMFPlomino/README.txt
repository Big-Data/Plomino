Plomino is a Plone/ZOPE product which provides users with a Lotus Domino-like application development toolkit.

Plone/ZOPE is a wonderful platform, but it might be difficult for a non-developer to design a Plone business-specific application other than standard content management: Archetypes are difficult to handle and need code, and Formulator does not offer enough features.

With Lotus Domino, a user can easily design databases able to handle very different business needs (knwoledge management, project management, collaborative workplaces, etc.).

What is missing in Plone/ZOPE to handle that ? Mainly the following points:

    * be able to create new structured content types, more specific than the core CMF types
    * be able to build differents views to list the same contents in different ways
    * be able to display content through dynamic forms


That is what Plomino aims to do.

Plomino is an opensource solution, distributed under ZPL (ZOPE Public License).
